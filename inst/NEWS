CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2.1
-------------------------

BUG FIXES
    o FAData and pedigree<- throw now an error if the IDs of the individuals are
      not unique.


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.9
-------------------------

BUG FIXES
    o Fixes to the Vignette and addition of citation.


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.9
-------------------------

BUG FIXES
    o Small fixes mainly to the Vignette and one left over problem from the git/svn
      conflict merge.


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.8
-------------------------

NEW FEATURES
    o FAData constructor recognizes *.ped and *.fam files and imports their
      pedigree information correctly.
    o export method to export pedigree information from a FAData to a ped or fam file.
    o Add methods getFounders and getSingletons.

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES
    o Founders are now represented by NA in columns 'father' and 'mother'. This fixed
      potential problems when IDs are character strings and not numeric.
    o Added column 'family' to the results of the probability test.
    o genealogicalIndexTest: renamed argument prune into rm.singletons.
    o Removed prune argument for methods calculating per-individual statistics.
    o Re-formated and re-structured the vignette.

BUG FIXES
    o Validation of pedigree information in FAData improved.
    o [ subsetting now ensures that father or mother IDs which are not available
      in column 'id' are set to NA.
    o clique names are no longer dropped when setting cliques(object) <- value.


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.6
-------------------------

NEW FEATURES
    o Monte Carlo simulation to assess significance of familial incidence
      rate and familial standardized incidence rates.
    o New FAIncidenceRateResults object along with its methods.
    o New FAStdIncidenceRateResults object along with its methods.
    o New function factor2matrix to convert a factor into a matrix.

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES
    o Vignette: extended content and adapted to use Bioconductor style.
    o Results from the kinship sum test are now, in addition to the p-value, also
      sorted by the kinship sum.

BUG FIXES
    o Fixed some problems in the documentation.


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.5
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES
    o Some changes related to the github repository.
    o Added a readme.org file.


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.4
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES
    o Renamed genealogicalIndex method into genealogicalIndexTest to conform the
      naming convention that all methods ending with Test use simulations to
      assess signifcance levels.



CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.3
-------------------------

NEW FEATURES
    o Stratified sampling for kinship group test.

BUG FIXES
    o Fixed a bug in plotPed related to optional labels.
    o Fixed a bug in familialIncidenceRate: self-self kinship was not excluded.



CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.2
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES
    o Vignette streamlining.



CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.1
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES
    o Fixed pdf export of vignette.

BUG FIXES
    o Removed the Haplopaint requirement checking during package loading as
      this resulted in errors on some systems.



CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.0
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES
    o Improved the vignette.
    o Fixed several issues in the documentation.



CHANGES IN VERSION 0.6.0
------------------------

NEW FEATURES
    o sliceAge function to define the time an individual spent per age stratum.


SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES
    o Removed the obsolete FAResult object; all result objects now inherit
      directly from FAData, that contains now also the trait information.
    o kinship returns now the kinship matrix with columns and rows corresponding
      to the ids in the internal pedigree.
    o Renamed the "kinship test" and FAKinshipResult in "kinship group test" and
      FAKinGroupResults.
    o Renamed the "kinship cluster test" and FAKinClustResult in "kinship sum test"
      and FAKinSumResults.
    o Renamed FAProbResult in FAProbResults.
    o Renamed FAGenIndexResult in FAGenIndexResults.
    o Renamed familialRate into familialIncidenceRate.



CHANGES IN VERSION 0.5.1
------------------------

BUG FIXES
    o Fixed the vignette reducing the number of permutations and the pedigree size.



CHANGES IN VERSION 0.5.0
------------------------

NEW FEATURES
    o plotRes for FAKinshipResult.
    o Stratified sampling for kinshipClusterTest.


BUG FIXES
    o The range of data values to be plotted includes now also the observed
      mean kinship value, thus, for results with an p-value=0 are also displayed
      correctly in plotRes for FAGenIndexResult.
    o Removed all CHRIS data sources and the related unit tests to compare new
      and old code.
    o Fixed a bug in the subsetting method ([) of FAData that did not return the
      correct kinship matrix.


SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES
    o Added parameter "only.phenotyped" to the plotPed method.
    o Added some more use cases and examples to the vignette.
    o Removed a lot of un-needed warnings.
    o Results methods of all analysis methods return now a p-value sorted data.frame.



CHANGES IN VERSION 0.4.0
------------------------

NEW FEATURES
    o Implemented the "familial incidence ratio" from Kerber (1995).


SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES
    o Removed warnings and "cleaned" analysis methods.




CHANGES IN VERSION 0.3.0
------------------------

NEW FEATURES
    o New methods to extract matched controls for given ids from the pedigree:
      getAll, getExternalMatched, getGenerationMatched, getGenerationSexMatched,
      getSexMatched.
    o Implemented the "genealogical index" method: FAGenIndexResult and related
      methods.
    o Implemented the plotting method plotRes to visualize simulation results (thus
      far only for FAGenIndexResult).


BUG FIXES
    o Kinships of 0.5 were by default removed in the kinship and the kinship cluster
      test to avoid considering self-self kinships. This resulted in erroneous kinship
      estimates if twins (also having a kinship of 0.5) were in the pedigree.
      Thus, now only the self-self kinship (i.e. diagonal of the kinship matrix) is
      excluded prior to the kinship aggregations.



SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES
    o Using kinship2 with device="plot" plotting by default.
    o New section in the vignette describing a genealogical index use-case.




CHANGES IN VERSION 0.2.0
------------------------

NEW FEATURES
    o Implemented methods countGenerations, estimateGenerations, generationsFrom,
      getSiblings, findFounders for FAData, data.frame, pedigree and pedigreeList.
    o Most pedigree functions (e.g. getChildren, getAncestors) can also be applied
      to data.frame, pedigree or pedigreeList objects.


SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES
    o Implemented the following methods for data.frame, pedigree and pedigreeList
      objects: getAncestors
    o Added arguments label1, label2 and label3 to plotPed that allow to further
      customize pedigree plots.
    o Some more examples added to the vignette.



CHANGES IN VERSION 0.1.0
------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES
    o Added support for argument is.proband in kinship2 plotting.


BUG FIXES
    o In plotPed, argument cex is passed down to plotting functions.
